This file contains setup and requirement notes for the project.


The server is implemented in Python using the Django Framework (https://www.djangoproject.com/)
as the core framework for the webserver.

A number of libraries are used in conjunction with the server.

The libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file in the 'server/' directory.


The project runs on Python 3.4. The libraries can be installed using the pip
package manager by running 'pip -r requirements.txt'


Additionally the library depends on the PyAIML3 library which can be found in the
project directory at 'server/pyaiml/'.
To install the library, run command
'python setup.py install' in the pyaiml directory.


The application uses the PostgreSQL Database system which has to be accessible
on localhost:5432. 
The web server uses the database service as user 'nombot' with
password 'feedme' and uses a database called 'nombot'. 
All these requirements
have to be met to enable the server using the database.

The user 'nombot' should have been granted full rights on the 'nombot' database.


The application registers a webhook at the Telegram bot api which pushes its messages
over a secure HTTPS-Connection. 
To fully use the prototype, it has to be accessible
over HTTPS-Connection with a valid SSL-Certificate.


The necessary database tables can be created by using the manage.py utility of the
django server. 
The manage.py script can be found in the 'server/nombot' directory.
To create the database migrations, run the command 'python manage.py makemigrations nombot'.

To apply the migrations to the database and create the necessary tables, run
'python manage.py migrate'.


To start up the server, run the command "python manage.py runserver <port>" while
in the 'server/nombot' directory.
